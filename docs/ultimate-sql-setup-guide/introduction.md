One of the hardest parts about starting with SQL is actually getting _somewhere_ to write the SQL in a way that works for you.

This is complicated because SQL isn't just a single language: there are _loads_ of different SQL dialects and lots of different ways to "do SQL".

This guide will take you through some options and help you figure out which option would be best for you.

**Outline**

1. The options: what's best for you?
2. [Online sites](./01-online-sites.md) → _"I just want to practice writing SQL queries"_
3. [Managed services](./02-managed-services.md) → _"I want my own data to be securely accessible from multiple machines"_
4. [Single-file databases](./03-single-file-databases.md) → _"I want my data to be on my machine, without installing much software"_
5. [DBMS systems (locally installed)](./04-dbms-system-locally-installed.md) → _"I want a local database that I install myself"_
6. [DBMS systems (via Docker)](./05-dbms-system-docker.md) → _"I want local databases without having to install vendor-specific software"_
7. [Self-managed services](./06-self-managed-services.md) → _"I want a self-managed remote database that can be accessed from multiple machines"_
8. [Extra: connecting to databases](connecting-to-databases.md)

## The options: what's best for you?

If you're a complete beginner, you probably want to start with an online site which already has some data and a way to write SQL.

Once you know the basics, it depends on what you want to focus on.
